This is a folder to host the version of solr 1.3 that works as the source to build 
the Sourcerer Solr Server. Upon initial checkout this folder will contain eclipse
project files and this file. Rest of the contents of this folder will be 
created as part of executing the ant target "fetch-patch-solr".
