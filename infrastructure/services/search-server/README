as a search server for Sourcerer code search service. This projects depends on a patched
version of the Apache solr project (v 1.3.0), and expects it be present as a project
imported in the Eclipse workspace. The Apache solr project source should reside in
 Sourcerer/infrastructure/services/solr-1.3-patched.
