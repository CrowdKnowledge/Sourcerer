Four methods for determining cloning:

1) Directory method
2) Hashing method
3) FQN method
4) Name fingerprint method

--General Stats--

**Want rates of file copying for each method (% of files that occur in more than one project)

Two projects, each with 100 files. 50 files are common between the two projects.

Method A (unique) - number copied / total
50 / 150 = 33%

Method B (all) - number copied / total
100 / 200 = 50%


**List (and classify) the most commonly copied (occurs in the highest number of projects) files according to all methods.

**List (and classify) the most copied projects (projects that have the highest percentage of copied files) according to all methods.
See if projects are true duplicates, or related in some manner

**Graph project size (# of files) vs percent of files that were copied
Look for projects that are completely copied (and possibly discount?)

**Analysis of the files that are commonly considered copies between methods.

Is (3) a strict superset of (2)? Is (4) a strict superset of (2)? How do (3) and (4) relate? How does (1) fit in?

**Correlate project forge origin (sourcerforge vs google code vs apache) and rates of copying

**Possibly look at copying rates across forges (lots of people copy apache? but not vice versa)
