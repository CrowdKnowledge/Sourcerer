<h1>Sourcerer Web-Services</h1>
<p>All the artifacts managed and stored in Sourcerer are 
accessible through a set of Web-services. Currently three 
services are open to public.</p>

<div class="sub">
<h3>Code Search</h3>
<p>This service implements a query processing facility. Client
applications (such as CodeGenie) can send queries as combination of
terms and fields and the service returns a result set with detailed
information on the entities that matched the queries. The query language
is based on Lucene's implementation and our extended query parser
supports different query forms that allow the clients to express more
structural information in the queries.</p>
<h3>Repository Access</h3>
<p>This service provides access to the code stored in the Managed
Repository in Sourcerer. Every entity that is stored in the Sourcerer
repository has a unique identifier and this service provides access to
the source of the entity given the unique id.</p>
<h3>Dependency Slicing</h3>
<p>This service provide access to extract dependency slices of
entities stored in the repository. Clients can request the slice by
specifying an entry point in the program. For example, if the entry
point is a method, request for a dependency slice for that method will
return a zip file. The zip contains newly fabricated compilation units
with much unnecessary code stripped off, as well as include some
meta-data detailing any unresolved external references.</p>
</div>

<p>These Web-Services have simple REST style
APIs. Given a reuest (via a valid URL) the client will get a response
back of appropriate format. All requests should be sent via a HTTP GET request with
parameters encoded in urls.</p>

<p> 
Given below are the instructions for how to construct valid requests
to the three Sourcerer Web-Services.
</p> 

<h2>Code Search API Description</h2>
<div class="sub">

<p>Search requests can be made by sending a valid URL to the Sourcerer
server. Such requests send back XML data that represents the results
for the requested query. Search requests have the following form:</p> 
 
<p><code> 
http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/ws-search/search?qry=[VALID_QUERY]&epp=[INT_VALUE]&pid=[INT_VALUE]&client=[CLIENTID]
</code></p> 
 
<p>The text inside the brackets above indicate parameters that need to
be filled in. The list below summarizes the parameters in the above URL</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="emph">qry:</span> A valid lucene query
	experssion. (Refer to a list below to see available fields). By default
	a conjunction (logical and) of all terms is considered.</li>
	<li><span class="emph">epp:</span> Number of entries to display
	(results) per page.</li>
	<li><span class="emph">pid:</span> Page index of the search result.</li>
	<li><span class="emph">client:</span> Client type. For example:
	"codegenie" or "webapp". This is for tracking purposes only, and does
	not affect search result.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Here is how a valid url looks like:<code> 
http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/ws-search/search?qry=sort&epp=10&pid=1&client=webclient
</code></p> 
 
<h3>Search Results</h3> 
 
<p>You can copy and paste the above url in a browser to see the result
returned by the search sevice. The XML represenation of the search
results returned by the service follows the following schema as shown
below.</p>

<h3>Index Fields</h3> 
 
<p> 
Please refer to these available index fields to see what index field names
you can use while constructing a query. Please refer this <a
	href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_2/queryparsersyntax.html">link</a> to
learn how to construct a valid lucene query.</p> 
 
<img src="img/indexfields.png"/> 
 
<h2>Dependency (Program) Slicing API Description</h2> 
<p> 
The URL request for dependency slicing has the following form:
</p> 
 
<p><code> 
http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/slicer/slice?eid=[ENTITY_ID]&client=[CLIENT_ID]
</code></p> 
 
<p> 
Values in the brackets above indicates required parameters.
Here is how a valid url looks like: 
</p> 
 
<p><code>http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/slicer/slice?eid=3148295&client=webapp</code></p> 
 
<p>This service works well after retrieving search results from the
code query service. Each result entry has a field that provides the
entity id of the entity that the entry represents. Using that value in
the slice request sends back a zip with sliced dependencies for that
entity.</p> 
 
<h2>File Server API Description</h2> 
<p> 
The File Server or the repository access service provides access to
all the source code in the Sourcerer repository. The URL has the
following form:
</p> 
 
<p><code> 
http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/repodata/resource?rp=[RELATVE_RESOURCE_PATH]&client=[CLIENT_ID]
</code></p> 
 
<p> 
The parameter 'rp' denotes the relative path of the resource in the
Sourcerer repository. For any entity this information is available in
the search result entry. Parameter 'client' has the same purpose and
as described in previous services. Here is how a valid url looks like: 
</p> 
 
<p><code> 
http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/sourcerer/repodata/resource?rp=8/454/src/delivery/java/org/stringtree/util/sort/Sorter.java&client=webapp
</code></p> 
 
 
<h2>Java Library</h2> 
 
<p> 
We have implemented a Java library that makes it easy to program the
Sourcerer search service. Using this library will take away the
overhead of unmarshalling the XML data returned by the search service.
Here is how you could import it in an IDE (Eclipse) and start
programming with the sourcerer search service.

<p>Please <a href="#contact">email the contact</a> below if you want
to obtain this library.</p> 
 
<h3>Programming</h3> 
 
<p>It is quite simple to program the search service using the library
mentioned above. You open a HTTP input stream with a valid URL, and, give it to the
<i>SearchResultUnMarshaller</i> class; that will give you a
<i>SearchResult</i> instance holding <i>SearchResultEntry</i> 
	instances. This is how it could look like:</p> 
 
<img src="./img/code.png"/>	
 
<p>Make sure you have all the HTTP parameters correct while creating
the URL if you do not get the results you expect.</p>
