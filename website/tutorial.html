Step 1: Download Sourcerer

Run
git clone https://github.com/sourcerer/Sourcerer.git
in the directory you wish to download Sourcerer, [install]

Step 2: Set up a Repository

For the purposes of the tutorial, there are three ways of doing this.
A) Create the test-repository
Navigate to the [install]/Sourcerer/bin directory and run
ant create-test-repo

This will create a test repository which can be found at 
[install]/Sourcerer/infrastructure/tools/java/extractor/test-repo
This test repository contains two projects, 0/0, a project for testing the 
feature extractor, and 0/1, the Sourcerer project itself.

B) Download a sample repository (more interesting)
A sample repository containing a small random selection of projects from 
the full repository can be found online at 
http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/files/sample-repo.tgz.
Simply download this file and extract it to the desired directory.

C) Download the full repository
The full repository can be found online at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/datasets/SDS_source-repo-18k.html
Simply download this file (very very big) and extract it to the desired directory.

Step 3: Compile the repository tools
To compile the basic repository tools, navigate to the [install]/Sourcerer/bin directory and run
ant repo-tools

This will create repo-tools.jar in the [install]/Sourcerer/bin/dist directory.

Run java -jar [path to repo-tools.jar] to see a complete list of commands provided by repo-tools.jar

Step 4: Finish setting up the repository
Note: If you used the create-test-repo ant task, these tasks have already been run and you may skip this step.

Run the following command to collect all of the jar files in the repository into the jars directory
java -jar [path to repo-tools.jar] --aggregate-jar-files --input-repo [path to repository]

To see the effect of running this command, navigate to [path to repository]. Notice that a new directory, jars, has been created, which in turn contains all of the jar files collection from the repository.

Next, run the following command to create the jar index
java -jar [path to repo-tools.jar] --create-jar-index --input-repo [path to repository]

To see the effect of running this command, navigate to [path-to-repository]/jars and notice a new file, index.txt.

Finally, run the following command to clean out the jar manifests
java -jar [path to repo-tools.jar] --clean-jar-manifests --input-repo [path to repository]

The effect of this command is to remove all classpath manifest entries from jar files contained in the jars directory.

Some other commands that might be interesting to run are:
print-repo-disk-usage
print-project-names
print-jar-stats
print-project-sizes

To see the list of required inputs for any command, run
java -jar [path to repo-tools.jar] --[command]

Each of the above commands only requires the input-repo parameter.

If you wish for the output logs to be saved to a file, the --output [path] parameter may be added. When this parameter is specified, logs are saved to [path]/[command name]/[date]/[time] and are no longer printed to the command line. To have them printed to the command line again, add the --report-to-console flag.

Step 5: Set up the Extractor
Unfortunately, as the extractor is an Eclipse plugin, this step cannot be done from the command line. The Eclipse-specific ant task extractor must be run, which requires the following Eclipse projects to be loaded: bin, extractor, model, repository-manager, and utilities.

Next, run the ant task
ant repackage-extractor

This task creates the final version of the extractor plugin, which can be found at [install]/Sourcerer/bin/dist/Extractor_1.0.0.jar

As the Extractor is a headless Eclipse plugin, it must be installed into a working Eclipse instance. This installation can be done as follows:
* Download a recent version of Eclipse and extract it to some directory [eclipse].
* Place the Extractor_1.0.0.jar file generated by the ant task in the [eclipse]/plugins directory

To test that it's working, try to run
java -jar [eclipse]/plugins/org.eclipse.[version-name].launcher_[version-number].jar -consolelog -application Extractor.Extractor

The result should be a list of the commands the extractor supports.

Step 6: Run the Extractor
The first step in extraction is to extract from the Java library code. To do so, run

java -jar [...] -application Extractor.Extractor --extract-libraries --output-repo [path] --output [path] &

It is recommended to run this in the background (using &), as it can take a while to complete. Also, due to Eclipse's headless functionality, output that is not directed using the --output parameter is blocked until completion of the application, so no updates are received.

You can track the progress of the extractor by running tail -f [output-path]/extract-libraries/[date]/[time]/error.log or info.log. 

The results of the extraction can be seen in [output-repo-path]/libs/. The extracted data for each Java library jar file is contained within the directory with that jar file's name. rt.jar contains the vast majority of the Java library. Looking into any directory, you can see the various flat files that are used to build the database.

Next, extract the jar files using
java -jar [...] -application Extractor.Extractor --extract-jars --input-repo [path] --output-repo [path] --output [path] &

Notice that an input-repo is needed this time, as the jar files are not being picked off the Java classpath.

The results of this extraction can be found in [output-repo-path]/jars/.

Lastly, extract the source files using
java -jar [...] -application Extractor.Extractor --extract-projects --input-repo [path] --output-repo [path] --output [path] &

The results of this extraction can be found in [output-repo-path].

To view some summary statistics of the extraction, please run
java -jar [path to repo-tools.jar] --extraction-stats --input-repo [path-to-output-repo]

This will create an extraction-stats.txt file which contains some details on what was extracted from the repository.

Step 7: Set up database
To complete the remainder of this tutorial, you must have access to a MySQL database to which the extracted information can be imported.

Once a mysql database is set up, the user simply needs to create a database by typing
create database [name];

And make sure to give the user you wish to use proper permissions
grant all on [name].* to [user];

Sourcerer database tools will handle the remainder.

Step 8: Set up the database tools
To compile the basic repository tools, navigate to the [install]/Sourcerer/bin directory and run
ant sourcerer-db

This will create a sourcerer-db.jar in [install]/Sourcerer/bin/dist

Step 9: Import to database

Start by initializing the tables.

java -jar [path to sourcerer-db.jar] --database-url jdbc:mysql://[url of database]/[name of database] --database-user [user] --database-password [password] --initialize-db

Then import the libraries

java -jar [path to sourcerer-db.jar] --database-url jdbc:mysql://[url of database]/[name of database] --database-user [user] --database-password [password] --add-libraries --input-repo [path-to-output-repo] --output &

Then import the jars

java -jar [path to sourcerer-db.jar] --database-url jdbc:mysql://[url of database]/[name of database] --database-user [user] --database-password [password] --add-jars --input-repo [path-to-output-repo] --output &

Then import the projects

java -jar [path to sourcerer-db.jar] --database-url jdbc:mysql://[url of database]/[name of database] --database-user [user] --database-password [password] --add-projects --input-repo [path-to-output-repo] --output &

It's best to run these as background processes, as they can take quite a while.

Step 10: Explore the database
Connect to the database and look around at what you have.

Further steps:
There are a variety of things that can be done once you have a repository up and running, but are beyond the scope of this tutorial. This includes how to set up a Lucene search index and a running version of the Sourcerer search engine, as well as tools for evaluating the amount of clones present in the repository. I hope this tutorial gives a bit of a sense of how Sourcerer works, and I would be happy to answer any further questions, or work out any issues there might be with these steps.
